# Important:
I did not know whether or not I was allowed to edit iteration 1 and 2 (or other old files), as were were still technically a group when I did them. There are many places I wanted to edit, (for example steps 2-4 iteration 1 are copied form the textbook because Manreet wanted to contribute but didnt know how, she fought me when I wanted to edit it and so I never did) but i decided it would be best if I just left it the same for claritys sake. 
There are no major structural additions or changes I wanted to edit, it was mainly format, spelling, tense, and other writing aspects that were done by group members attempting to contribute. I did all the major elements of the design, so that is okay.
However, hopefully this will not massively impact my grade as it is essentially out of my control. I would rather lose a mark assuming i should leave them alone than do something im not allowed to and get 0.
Therefore, iteration 3 is very in-depth with my decisions and hopefully it can provide an off-set for my grade in the project. Thanks!

#### [5. iteration 2](iteration%202.pdf)
#### [6. iteration 3](iteration%203.pdf)
### If you would prefer a .md file:
#### [7. Iteration 1](Other%20README%20files/iteration1.md)
#### [8. Iteration 2](Other%20README%20files/iteration2.md)
#### [9. Iteration 3](Other%20README%20files/iteration3.md)
#### These are not visually appealing as they are auto-generated, therefore they do not have pictures and are formatted badly.
#### It would have taken a very long time to completely redo all the formatting in an md file without auto-generating it.
#### I tried several convertors, all of them were unique but none were exceptional, the one I picked was the only one that displayed tables correctly.
