# Overview
Art Gallery is a website that allows users to create accounts to browse art, purchase art, and display their own art for sale.
The system features a login/account system with a payment system for ordering art and paying clients who sell their art on the website.
The system administrator and database technician manages the website by addign removing art pieces, changing prices, and editing accounts, among other privileges.

# Justification and Objective
The justification for Art Gallery is that artists need a place to buy and sell their work. Not only do artists need a platform, but clients looking to purchase the art need a place to go.
With Art Gallery, we are providing that connection between artists and their admirers.

# Phases of work
Phase I: Collecting information and requirements from users and understanding the domain of the problem. Sep 6 - Oct 11 
Phase II: designing use case models and setting constraints and quality attributes Oct 12 â€“ Nov 8
Phase III: developing the website according to the design and requirements. Nov 5 - Dec 6

# Metrics for evaluating and monitoring
The most important metric is making sure the deliverables stay relevant to the scope of the project. 
The system must also meet its functional and non-functional requirements. For example, users can buy and sell art on the website. 
The system must also have low overall operational errors to promote performance, usability, and modifiability.
